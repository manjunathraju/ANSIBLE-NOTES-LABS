variables continue:

prog 5: wirte an ansible playbook variables declare in host inventory files.

step1: Goto vi /etc/ansible/hosts

192.168.1.1 mypkg= apache2,php,mysql mydir=/opt/tomcat
172.16.1.1  mypkg= nodejs,npm,mongo mydir=/opt/MERN

---
- name: Install java on ubuntu
  hosts: all
  become: yes   
  tasks:    
    - name: Install apache server
      apt:
        name: "{{mypkg}}"
        update_cache= yes
        state: present        
    
    - name: create directory
      file:
        path: "{{mydir}}"
        state: directory

# It read the variable from host inventory file and install on host servers

NOTE: vars declare inside file & declars var in host inventory file ansible which gives high priority to variable declared in host inventory file.

prog 6:

Group based host variable:
Declaring an variable in host inventory file for multiple ip's its very difficult to maintain for solution 

vi /etc/ansible/hosts

prog 7:

On invertory host file group declared 100 of server ip address, suppose i need to install different packages on 1 server out of 100, here is the solution
Note: On 192.168.1.1 particular server it will only install the variable litespped and rest of other ip address on web group it will install variable declared on [web:vars].

vi /etc/ansible/hosts

ANSIBLE LOOPS
  - simple loop: item, with_items -- pre defined variables used in loops in ansible
  - nested loop
  - hash loop


simple Loops is used ie suppose need to copy multiple files at time on all hosts server
eg: 
---
- name: coping files
  hosts: all
  become: yes   
  tasks:    
    - copy:
        src: /etc/passwd
	dest: /tmp/
    - copy:
        src: /etc/shadow
	dest: /tmp/
     - copy:
        src: /etc/groups
	dest: /tmp/

But this is not an good practice to COPY files to host servers, but using loops can multiple copies an files to host server here is the solution:

---
- name: coping files
  hosts: all
  become: yes   
  tasks:    
    - copy:
        src: "{{ item }}"
	dest: /tmp/
      with_items:
        - /etc/passwd
        - /etc/shadow
	- /etc/groups
