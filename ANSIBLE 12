      - { username: 'ramesh', groupname: 'prod-tem' }
      
#It will create username and group using ansible using hasing loop
grep dev-tem /etc/groups
grep ramesh /etc/passwd

-----------------------------------------------------------

Ansible conditional or conditions : When ansible condition is true then only ansible will process the task.


ex: - hosts: all
      tasks:
	- apt:
	    name: apache2
	    state: present
	  when: ansible_distribution == ubuntu

conditions:
==
!=
<
<=
>
>=
and 
or

Prog 1: Install apache software only on ubuntu OS using conditions

---
- name: Install apache2 on ubuntu
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
    when: ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'
    when: ansible_distribution_major_version == 18

NOTE: Here when condition is try to check last condition is true the playbook will execute, if when first condition is true and last condition is false the palybook will not execute similarly viseversa when first condtion is false and last condition is true the ansible palybook will get executed.

example 1: Here in this ex playbook will be executed when ansible last condition is true

---
- name: Install apache2 on ubuntu
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
    when: ansible_distribution == 'Centos'
    when: ansible_distribution_major_version == 18

example 2: Here in this ex playbook will be not executed when ansible last condition is false.

---
- name: Install apache2 on ubuntu
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
    when: ansible_distribution == 'Ubuntu'
    when: ansible_distribution_major_version == 7

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Prog 2: Ansible less than ( < ) condition = when ansible is less than version it will execute the playbook.

---
- name: Install apache2 on ubuntu
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
    when: ansible_distribution_major_version < '19'
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Prog 3:

AND condition: When both condition are true then ansible playbook will execute.

---
- name: Install apache2 on ubuntu
  hosts: all
  tasks:
  - apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
    when: ansible_distribution_major_version == '18' and ansible_os_family== 'Ubuntu'
