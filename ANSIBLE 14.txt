ANSIBLE 14

Ansible tags, Ansible ignore_errors, ansible blocks, rescue, always, ansible vault.

ANSIBLE TAGS: In ansible playbook file having multiple tasks, suppose if i need execute particular tasks on playbook we use ansible tags.
eg:
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - copy:
        src: /etc/passwd
	dest: /tmp
      tags: dev-team
    
    - file:
	path: /tmp/reaj
	state: directory
      tags: test-team

$ ansible-playbook filename.yaml
$ansible-playbook filename.yaml --tags=dev-team

suppose if you want to execute other tasks ie file task:
$ansible-playbook filename.yaml --tags=test-team

Prog1: 

---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - copy:
        src: /etc/passwd
	dest: /tmp
      tags: dev-team
    
    - file:
	path: /tmp/reaj
	state: directory
      tags: test-team
    
     - apt:
	name: apache2
	state: present
       tags: prod-team

     - service:
	name: apache2
	enabled: yes
	state: started
       tags: admin-team

$anbile-playbook filename.yaml 
$ansible-playbook filename.yaml --tags=dev-team # only copy module will be executed.
$ansible-playbook filename.yaml --skip-tags=dev-team #It will skip the dev-team tag and execute other task modules on playbook.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ansible ignore_errors: Usally on ansible playbook if any one task gets fail the ansible playbook will comeout throw an error it will not execute other tasks, ansible ignore_error is use when one task gets an error it ignores and execute other task on ansible playbook
Prog1 eg:

---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - copy:
        src: /etc/group123 #Here copy task has error, so it ignores and execute other tasks
	dest: /tmp
      ignore_errors: yes
    
    - file:
	path: /tmp/reaj
	state: directory
      ignore_errors: yes
    
     - apt:
	name: apache2
	state: present
       ignore_errors: yes

     - service:
	name: apache2
	enabled: yes
	state: started
       ignore_errors: yes
